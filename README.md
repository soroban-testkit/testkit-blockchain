# soroban-testkit

**The testing crate you would have written yourself, on the third contract.**

Testing infrastructure for Soroban contracts: property-test generators for
money math, an event-assertion API, ledger time and TTL-expiry control,
token test doubles, and a coverage-aware CLI.

`soroban-sdk` ships `testutils`, which is adequate for basic unit tests. It
is not adequate for testing contracts that hold money. Every serious
Soroban contract repo independently rebuilds some subset of:

- Advancing ledger time correctly, including the interaction between
  `timestamp` and `sequence`
- Asserting on emitted events without hand-decoding `Val` topics
- Generating adversarial `i128` values that actually find overflow bugs
- Deploying and funding a Stellar Asset Contract token double for transfer
  tests
- Proving that every privileged entry point rejects unauthorized callers
- Simulating TTL expiry

`soroban-testkit` is that shared layer, as a dev-dependency crate plus a
small CLI.

## Status

This crate is under active development. See `BUILD_SPEC.md` for the build
plan and module boundaries.

## Prior art

[`soroban-fork`](https://crates.io/crates/soroban-fork) does lazy
mainnet/testnet forking for tests. That is a different problem;
`soroban-testkit` does not attempt it.
