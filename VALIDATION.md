# Validation against a real contract suite

Module 10 of `BUILD_SPEC.md`. Target: [sororail-contracts](https://github.com/Sororail/sororail-contracts)
(local checkout at the time of this exercise: `/home/emmanuel/sororail`,
branch `sororail-contracts`), a real, unreleased Soroban contract suite —
`batch_payout`, `escrow`, `stream`, `vesting`, `recurring`, plus a shared
`common` crate — on the same soroban-sdk 27.0.6 this crate targets.

This was a time-boxed pass, not an exhaustive one: it goes deep on one
contract (`vesting`) rather than shallow across all six. That scope
decision, and what's left, is stated plainly in [What this didn't
cover](#what-this-didnt-cover).

## Setup

Added `soroban-testkit` as a path dev-dependency to `contracts/vesting`:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
soroban-testkit = { path = "../../../soroban-testkit/crates/testkit" }
```

This is a local-path dependency for the validation exercise. The change
lives in the sororail checkout on disk but was **not committed or pushed**
to that repository — it's not this session's repo to commit to without
asking first.

## 1. Rewriting `vesting`'s tests with soroban-testkit

`contracts/vesting/src/test.rs`: 32 tests, 495 lines before, 32 tests,
615 lines after.

**Line count went up, not down** — worth stating plainly rather than
picking the flattering framing. What changed:

- The Fixture's manual `Env::default()` / `Address::generate` /
  `register_stellar_asset_contract_v2` / `StellarAssetClient::mint`
  plumbing became `TestEnv::new()` / `env.address()` / `env.token()` /
  `token.mint_raw()` — a wash on line count, a readability win.
- `env.ledger().with_mut(|l| l.timestamp = ts)` became `env.warp_to(ts)` —
  same story.
- The file's own hand-rolled `assert_conserved()` (which every one of
  escrow/stream/vesting's test files independently reimplements) became
  a call to `soroban_testkit::money::Conservation::assert_holds()` — a
  small win, and the real payoff is architectural: one conservation
  implementation instead of three near-identical copies, with a better
  failure message than any of the three had.
- Three separate `#[should_panic]` auth tests (one per entry point,
  ~15 lines each, checking only "some auth is required") became two
  `AuthMatrix::assert_enforced()` tests that check the **same** three
  entry points *and* that the wrong party (grantor cannot claim,
  beneficiary cannot revoke) is rejected — strictly more coverage, but
  each entry point needs a fully-specified `MockAuthInvoke` (exact args,
  and — this took real debugging to discover — exact `sub_invokes` for
  any nested cross-contract call the entry point makes internally, e.g.
  `create`'s token transfer). That specification is more verbose than
  the `#[should_panic]` test it replaced.

**Net effect**: more coverage (rejection of the *wrong* party is now
actually asserted, not just "some auth is required"), for more code, in
this specific case. `AuthMatrix` is a better fit for a contract with
several entry points and a rich set of actors to cross-check (its stated
purpose) than for replacing a single well-targeted `#[should_panic]`
test one-for-one. Filed as a real finding rather than smoothed over.

## 2. Auth enforcement (`AuthMatrix`)

Ran `AuthMatrix::assert_enforced()` against `vesting`'s three privileged
entry points (`create`, `claim`, `revoke`). **No findings** — grantor and
beneficiary are exactly who the contract's own code says they should be,
and every other known address is correctly rejected for each. A clean
result, and a real one: getting these tests to pass required accurately
modeling `create`'s nested token-transfer authorization, which is exactly
the kind of thing a hand-written `#[should_panic]` test doesn't force you
to get right (it just needs *an* auth failure, not a specific one).

## 3. Conservation (`assert_conserved_over`)

Added a test driving `vesting`'s full lifecycle (create → ten incremental
claims spanning the whole vesting duration) through
`soroban_testkit::money::assert_conserved_over`, checking `total ==
claimed + returned + remaining` after every step. Passes — consistent
with `vesting`'s own pre-existing, more manually-driven conservation
tests (`conservation_holds_across_claim_then_revoke_then_claim`, etc.),
which also all pass unchanged.

## 4. Resource limits (`soroban-testkit limits`)

`batch_payout`'s `types.rs` documents `MAX_RECIPIENTS = 40`, with a
comment stating it was *measured*, not guessed, via a hand-rolled
`std::panic::catch_unwind` ramp in that crate's own `test.rs`
(`largest_batch_that_executes`) — the exact pattern Module 9's `limits`
subcommand exists to replace with a general tool.

Built `batch_payout` to `wasm32v1-none` and ran:

```
soroban-testkit limits --contract target/wasm32v1-none/release/sororail_batch_payout.wasm \
  --fn execute_equal --ramp recipients
```

Result:

```
last successful recipients for "execute_equal": 40
  instructions: 10174175
  memory bytes: 3033903
```

**40 — an exact, independent match** to sororail's own hand-measured
constant. This is the strongest evidence in this validation pass: a
general-purpose tool, run against a contract it has never seen, landed
on the same number a contract-specific hand-rolled ramp test found.

### Two real bugs in soroban-testkit, found by this exact run

Getting to that result required fixing `soroban-testkit` itself — this
is exactly the kind of thing Module 10 exists to surface:

1. **`limits` never mocked authorization.** `execute_equal` calls
   `funder.require_auth()`; with no auth setup at all, every attempt
   failed at the smallest ramp value before resource limits were ever
   relevant. Fixed by calling `mock_all_auths_allowing_non_root_auth()`
   on each probe's own throwaway `Env` — safe specifically because each
   probe is an isolated, single-use process (see the CLI's own
   commit message for why this would be wrong in a shared `TestEnv`).
2. **Numeric defaults were `0`.** `execute_equal`'s `amount_each: i128`
   is validated positive; the default `0` was rejected outright.
   Changed the default to `1`.
3. Along the way, a `token: Address` parameter needed a real, funded
   Stellar Asset Contract (since the function calls `transfer()` on it),
   not an arbitrary address — added a name-based heuristic (params
   literally named `token` get a deployed, funded SAC) documented as
   exactly that: a heuristic, not a semantic guarantee.

All three are fixed on `main` (see `fix(cli): make limits usable against
a real auth-gated payout contract`), with the full workspace test suite
green afterward.

## What this didn't cover

Time-boxed scope decisions, stated so they aren't mistaken for "nothing
else needed checking":

- **`AuthMatrix` and conservation checks were run against `vesting`
  only**, not `escrow`, `stream`, `recurring`, or `batch_payout`'s own
  auth model. The build spec asks for AuthMatrix "across every
  contract" — a natural, well-scoped follow-up, and each contract would
  be its own reasonably-sized unit of work given what `vesting` took.
- **No bug was found in sororail-contracts itself.** Every check that
  ran, passed. That's a genuine "nothing found" result for the checks
  that were run, not a claim that the other four contracts are equally
  clean — they weren't checked.
- The `vesting` test rewrite exists only in the local sororail checkout,
  uncommitted there — this repository has no ability to modify or
  publish to sororail-contracts, and wasn't asked to.
